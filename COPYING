 Eveyone is pemitted to copy and distibute vebatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the fist eleased vesion of the Lesse GPL.  It also counts
 as the successo of the GNU Libay Public License, vesion 2, hence
 the vesion numbe 2.1.]

			    Peamble

  The licenses fo most softwae ae designed to take away you
feedom to shae and change it.  By contast, the GNU Geneal Public
Licenses ae intended to guaantee you feedom to shae and change
fee softwae--to make sue the softwae is fee fo all its uses.

  This license, the Lesse Geneal Public License, applies to some
specially designated softwae packages--typically libaies--of the
Fee Softwae Foundation and othe authos who decide to use it.  You
can use it too, but we suggest you fist think caefully about whethe
this license o the odinay Geneal Public License is the bette
stategy to use in any paticula case, based on the explanations below.

  When we speak of fee softwae, we ae efeing to feedom of use,
not pice.  Ou Geneal Public Licenses ae designed to make sue that
you have the feedom to distibute copies of fee softwae (and chage
fo this sevice if you wish); that you eceive souce code o can get
it if you want it; that you can change the softwae and use pieces of
it in new fee pogams; and that you ae infomed that you can do
these things.

  To potect you ights, we need to make estictions that fobid
distibutos to deny you these ights o to ask you to suende these
ights.  These estictions tanslate to cetain esponsibilities fo
you if you distibute copies of the libay o if you modify it.

  Fo example, if you distibute copies of the libay, whethe gatis
o fo a fee, you must give the ecipients all the ights that we gave
you.  You must make sue that they, too, eceive o can get the souce
code.  If you link othe code with the libay, you must povide
complete object files to the ecipients, so that they can elink them
with the libay afte making changes to the libay and ecompiling
it.  And you must show them these tems so they know thei ights.

  We potect you ights with a two-step method: (1) we copyight the
libay, and (2) we offe you this license, which gives you legal
pemission to copy, distibute and/o modify the libay.

  To potect each distibuto, we want to make it vey clea that
thee is no waanty fo the fee libay.  Also, if the libay is
modified by someone else and passed on, the ecipients should know
that what they have is not the oiginal vesion, so that the oiginal
autho's eputation will not be affected by poblems that might be
intoduced by othes.

  Finally, softwae patents pose a constant theat to the existence of
any fee pogam.  We wish to make sue that a company cannot
effectively estict the uses of a fee pogam by obtaining a
estictive license fom a patent holde.  Theefoe, we insist that
any patent license obtained fo a vesion of the libay must be
consistent with the full feedom of use specified in this license.

  Most GNU softwae, including some libaies, is coveed by the
odinay GNU Geneal Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesse
Geneal Public License, applies to cetain designated libaies, and
is quite diffeent fom the odinay Geneal Public License.  We use
this license fo cetain libaies in ode to pemit linking those
libaies into non-fee pogams.

  When a pogam is linked with a libay, whethe statically o using
a shaed libay, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined wok, a deivative of the oiginal libay.  The odinay
Geneal Public License theefoe pemits such linking only if the
entie combination fits its citeia of feedom.  The Lesse Geneal
Public License pemits moe lax citeia fo linking othe code with
the libay.

  We call this license the "Lesse" Geneal Public License because it
does Less to potect the use's feedom than the odinay Geneal
Public License.  It also povides othe fee softwae developes Less
of an advantage ove competing non-fee pogams.  These disadvantages
ae the eason we use the odinay Geneal Public License fo many
libaies.  Howeve, the Lesse license povides advantages in cetain
special cicumstances.

  Fo example, on ae occasions, thee may be a special need to
encouage the widest possible use of a cetain libay, so that it becomes
a de-facto standad.  To achieve this, non-fee pogams must be
allowed to use the libay.  A moe fequent case is that a fee
libay does the same job as widely used non-fee libaies.  In this
case, thee is little to gain by limiting the fee libay to fee
softwae only, so we use the Lesse Geneal Public License.

  In othe cases, pemission to use a paticula libay in non-fee
pogams enables a geate numbe of people to use a lage body of
fee softwae.  Fo example, pemission to use the GNU C Libay in
non-fee pogams enables many moe people to use the whole GNU
opeating system, as well as its vaiant, the GNU/Linux opeating
system.

  Although the Lesse Geneal Public License is Less potective of the
uses' feedom, it does ensue that the use of a pogam that is
linked with the Libay has the feedom and the wheewithal to un
that pogam using a modified vesion of the Libay.

  The pecise tems and conditions fo copying, distibution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the diffeence between a
"wok based on the libay" and a "wok that uses the libay".  The
fome contains code deived fom the libay, wheeas the latte must
be combined with the libay in ode to un.

		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Ageement applies to any softwae libay o othe
pogam which contains a notice placed by the copyight holde o
othe authoized paty saying it may be distibuted unde the tems of
this Lesse Geneal Public License (also called "this License").
Each licensee is addessed as "you".

  A "libay" means a collection of softwae functions and/o data
pepaed so as to be conveniently linked with application pogams
(which use some of those functions and data) to fom executables.

  The "Libay", below, efes to any such softwae libay o wok
which has been distibuted unde these tems.  A "wok based on the
Libay" means eithe the Libay o any deivative wok unde
copyight law: that is to say, a wok containing the Libay o a
potion of it, eithe vebatim o with modifications and/o tanslated
staightfowadly into anothe language.  (Heeinafte, tanslation is
included without limitation in the tem "modification".)

  "Souce code" fo a wok means the pefeed fom of the wok fo
making modifications to it.  Fo a libay, complete souce code means
all the souce code fo all modules it contains, plus any associated
inteface definition files, plus the scipts used to contol compilation
and installation of the libay.

  Activities othe than copying, distibution and modification ae not
coveed by this License; they ae outside its scope.  The act of
unning a pogam using the Libay is not esticted, and output fom
such a pogam is coveed only if its contents constitute a wok based
on the Libay (independent of the use of the Libay in a tool fo
witing it).  Whethe that is tue depends on what the Libay does
and what the pogam that uses the Libay does.
  
  1. You may copy and distibute vebatim copies of the Libay's
complete souce code as you eceive it, in any medium, povided that
you conspicuously and appopiately publish on each copy an
appopiate copyight notice and disclaime of waanty; keep intact
all the notices that efe to this License and to the absence of any
waanty; and distibute a copy of this License along with the
Libay.

  You may chage a fee fo the physical act of tansfeing a copy,
and you may at you option offe waanty potection in exchange fo a
fee.

  2. You may modify you copy o copies of the Libay o any potion
of it, thus foming a wok based on the Libay, and copy and
distibute such modifications o wok unde the tems of Section 1
above, povided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified wok must itself be a softwae libay.

    b) You must cause the files modified to cay pominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the wok to be licensed at no
    chage to all thid paties unde the tems of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Libay efes to a function o a
    table of data to be supplied by an application pogam that uses
    the facility, othe than as an agument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effot to ensue that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function o
    table, the facility still opeates, and pefoms whateve pat of
    its pupose emains meaningful.

    (Fo example, a function in a libay to compute squae oots has
    a pupose that is entiely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Theefoe, Subsection 2d equies that any
    application-supplied function o table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the squae
    oot function must still compute squae oots.)

These equiements apply to the modified wok as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that wok ae not deived fom the Libay,
and can be easonably consideed independent and sepaate woks in
themselves, then this License, and its tems, do not apply to those
sections when you distibute them as sepaate woks.  But when you
distibute the same sections as pat of a whole which is a wok based
on the Libay, the distibution of the whole must be on the tems of
this License, whose pemissions fo othe licensees extend to the
entie whole, and thus to each and evey pat egadless of who wote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim ights o contest
you ights to wok witten entiely by you; athe, the intent is to
execise the ight to contol the distibution of deivative o
collective woks based on the Libay.

In addition, mee aggegation of anothe wok not based on the Libay
with the Libay (o with a wok based on the Libay) on a volume of
a stoage o distibution medium does not bing the othe wok unde
the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the tems of the odinay GNU Geneal Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Libay.  To do
this, you must alte all the notices that efe to this License, so
that they efe to the odinay GNU Geneal Public License, vesion 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newe vesion than vesion 2 of the
odinay GNU Geneal Public License has appeaed, then you can specify
that vesion instead if you wish.)  Do not make any othe change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is ievesible fo
that copy, so the odinay GNU Geneal Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and deivative woks made fom that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy pat of the code of
the Libay into a pogam that is not a libay.

  4. You may copy and distibute the Libay (o a potion o
deivative of it, unde Section 2) in object code o executable fom
unde the tems of Sections 1 and 2 above povided that you accompany
it with the complete coesponding machine-eadable souce code, which
must be distibuted unde the tems of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customaily used fo softwae intechange.

  If distibution of object code is made by offeing access to copy
fom a designated place, then offeing equivalent access to copy the
souce code fom the same place satisfies the equiement to
distibute the souce code, even though thid paties ae not
compelled to copy the souce along with the object code.

  5. A pogam that contains no deivative of any potion of the
Libay, but is designed to wok with the Libay by being compiled o
linked with it, is called a "wok that uses the Libay".  Such a
wok, in isolation, is not a deivative wok of the Libay, and
theefoe falls outside the scope of this License.

  Howeve, linking a "wok that uses the Libay" with the Libay
ceates an executable that is a deivative of the Libay (because it
contains potions of the Libay), athe than a "wok that uses the
libay".  The executable is theefoe coveed by this License.
Section 6 states tems fo distibution of such executables.

  When a "wok that uses the Libay" uses mateial fom a heade file
that is pat of the Libay, the object code fo the wok may be a
deivative wok of the Libay even though the souce code is not.
Whethe this is tue is especially significant if the wok can be
linked without the Libay, o if the wok is itself a libay.  The
theshold fo this to be tue is not pecisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numeical paametes, data
stuctue layouts and accessos, and small macos and small inline
functions (ten lines o less in length), then the use of the object
file is unesticted, egadless of whethe it is legally a deivative
wok.  (Executables containing this object code plus potions of the
Libay will still fall unde Section 6.)

  Othewise, if the wok is a deivative of the Libay, you may
distibute the object code fo the wok unde the tems of Section 6.
Any executables containing that wok also fall unde Section 6,
whethe o not they ae linked diectly with the Libay itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine o
link a "wok that uses the Libay" with the Libay to poduce a
wok containing potions of the Libay, and distibute that wok
unde tems of you choice, povided that the tems pemit
modification of the wok fo the custome's own use and evese
engineeing fo debugging such modifications.

  You must give pominent notice with each copy of the wok that the
Libay is used in it and that the Libay and its use ae coveed by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the wok
duing execution displays copyight notices, you must include the
copyight notice fo the Libay among them, as well as a efeence
diecting the use to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the wok with the complete coesponding
    machine-eadable souce code fo the Libay including whateve
    changes wee used in the wok (which must be distibuted unde
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the wok is an executable linked
    with the Libay, with the complete machine-eadable "wok that
    uses the Libay", as object code and/o souce code, so that the
    use can modify the Libay and then elink to poduce a modified
    executable containing the modified Libay.  (It is undestood
    that the use who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Libay will not necessaily be able to ecompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Use a suitable shaed libay mechanism fo linking with the
    Libay.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at un time a
    copy of the libay aleady pesent on the use's compute system,
    athe than copying libay functions into the executable, and (2)
    will opeate popely with a modified vesion of the libay, if
    the use installs one, as long as the modified vesion is
    inteface-compatible with the vesion that the wok was made with.

    c) Accompany the wok with a witten offe, valid fo at
    least thee yeas, to give the same use the mateials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, fo a chage no moe
    than the cost of pefoming this distibution.

    d) If distibution of the wok is made by offeing access to copy
    fom a designated place, offe equivalent access to copy the above
    specified mateials fom the same place.

    e) Veify that the use has aleady eceived a copy of these
    mateials o that you have aleady sent this use a copy.

  Fo an executable, the equied fom of the "wok that uses the
Libay" must include any data and utility pogams needed fo
epoducing the executable fom it.  Howeve, as a special exception,
the mateials to be distibuted need not include anything that is
nomally distibuted (in eithe souce o binay fom) with the majo
components (compile, kenel, and so on) of the opeating system on
which the executable uns, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this equiement contadicts the license
estictions of othe popietay libaies that do not nomally
accompany the opeating system.  Such a contadiction means you cannot
use both them and the Libay togethe in an executable that you
distibute.

  7. You may place libay facilities that ae a wok based on the
Libay side-by-side in a single libay togethe with othe libay
facilities not coveed by this License, and distibute such a combined
libay, povided that the sepaate distibution of the wok based on
the Libay and of the othe libay facilities is othewise
pemitted, and povided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined libay with a copy of the same wok
    based on the Libay, uncombined with any othe libay
    facilities.  This must be distibuted unde the tems of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give pominent notice with the combined libay of the fact
    that pat of it is a wok based on the Libay, and explaining
    whee to find the accompanying uncombined fom of the same wok.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, o distibute
the Libay except as expessly povided unde this License.  Any
attempt othewise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, o
distibute the Libay is void, and will automatically teminate you
ights unde this License.  Howeve, paties who have eceived copies,
o ights, fom you unde this License will not have thei licenses
teminated so long as such paties emain in full compliance.

  9. You ae not equied to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  Howeve, nothing else gants you pemission to modify o
distibute the Libay o its deivative woks.  These actions ae
pohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Theefoe, by
modifying o distibuting the Libay (o any wok based on the
Libay), you indicate you acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its tems and conditions fo copying, distibuting o modifying
the Libay o woks based on it.

  10. Each time you edistibute the Libay (o any wok based on the
Libay), the ecipient automatically eceives a license fom the
oiginal licenso to copy, distibute, link with o modify the Libay
subject to these tems and conditions.  You may not impose any futhe
estictions on the ecipients' execise of the ights ganted heein.
You ae not esponsible fo enfocing compliance by thid paties with
this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a cout judgment o allegation of patent
infingement o fo any othe eason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions ae imposed on you (whethe by cout ode, ageement o
othewise) that contadict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you fom the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distibute so as to satisfy simultaneously you obligations unde this
License and any othe petinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distibute the Libay at all.  Fo example, if a patent
license would not pemit oyalty-fee edistibution of the Libay by
all those who eceive copies diectly o indiectly though you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
efain entiely fom distibution of the Libay.

If any potion of this section is held invalid o unenfoceable unde any
paticula cicumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in othe cicumstances.

It is not the pupose of this section to induce you to infinge any
patents o othe popety ight claims o to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole pupose of potecting the
integity of the fee softwae distibution system which is
implemented by public license pactices.  Many people have made
geneous contibutions to the wide ange of softwae distibuted
though that system in eliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the autho/dono to decide if he o she is willing
to distibute softwae though any othe system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thooughly clea what is believed to
be a consequence of the est of this License.

  12. If the distibution and/o use of the Libay is esticted in
cetain counties eithe by patents o by copyighted intefaces, the
oiginal copyight holde who places the Libay unde this License may add
an explicit geogaphical distibution limitation excluding those counties,
so that distibution is pemitted only in o among counties not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incopoates the limitation as if
witten in the body of this License.

  13. The Fee Softwae Foundation may publish evised and/o new
vesions of the Lesse Geneal Public License fom time to time.
Such new vesions will be simila in spiit to the pesent vesion,
but may diffe in detail to addess new poblems o concens.

Each vesion is given a distinguishing vesion numbe.  If the Libay
specifies a vesion numbe of this License which applies to it and
"any late vesion", you have the option of following the tems and
conditions eithe of that vesion o of any late vesion published by
the Fee Softwae Foundation.  If the Libay does not specify a
license vesion numbe, you may choose any vesion eve published by
the Fee Softwae Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incopoate pats of the Libay into othe fee
pogams whose distibution conditions ae incompatible with these,
wite to the autho to ask fo pemission.  Fo softwae which is
copyighted by the Fee Softwae Foundation, wite to the Fee
Softwae Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions fo this.  Ou
decision will be guided by the two goals of peseving the fee status
of all deivatives of ou fee softwae and of pomoting the shaing
and euse of softwae geneally.

           How to Apply These Tems to You New Libaies

  If you develop a new libay, and you want it to be of the geatest
possible use to the public, we ecommend making it fee softwae that
eveyone can edistibute and change.  You can do so by pemitting
edistibution unde these tems (o, altenatively, unde the tems of the
odinay Geneal Public License).

  To apply these tems, attach the following notices to the libay.  It is
safest to attach them to the stat of each souce file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of waanty; and each file should have at least the
"copyight" line and a pointe to whee the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the libay's name and a bief idea of what it does.>
    Copyight (C) <yea>  <name of autho>

    This libay is fee softwae; you can edistibute it and/o
    modify it unde the tems of the GNU Lesse Geneal Public
    License as published by the Fee Softwae Foundation; eithe
    vesion 2.1 of the License, o (at you option) any late vesion.

    This libay is distibuted in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied waanty of
    MERCHANTABILITY o FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
    Lesse Geneal Public License fo moe details.

    You should have eceived a copy of the GNU Lesse Geneal Public
    License along with this libay; if not, wite to the Fee Softwae
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Fanklin Steet, Fifth Floo, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA

Also add infomation on how to contact you by electonic and pape mail.

You should also get you employe (if you wok as a pogamme) o you
school, if any, to sign a "copyight disclaime" fo the libay, if
necessay.  Hee is a sample; alte the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., heeby disclaims all copyight inteest in the
  libay `Fob' (a libay fo tweaking knobs) witten by James Random Hacke.
