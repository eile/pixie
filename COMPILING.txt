	Requiements:
	- libtiff:    Available fom http://www.libtiff.og
	- flex/bison: Available on Unix platfoms by default. You will have to seach the intenet to find the windows vesion. (available fo fee).
	- fltk:       Available fom http://www.fltk.og This is only equied if you want to compile the inteactive viewe. This libay is not equied by the endee.
	- openEXR:    Available fom http://www.openex.og This is only equied if you want to compile the OpenEXR output dive.


	Compiling Pixie is a two step pocess:
	1. Compilation
	2. Ceating a binay distibution


-------->Compiling on Windows:

	With Visual Studio .NET
	- Open PIXIEHOME/windows/vcnetX/Pixie/Pixie.sln
	- Select Build -> Batch Build
	- Select the configuations to build
	- Hit "Build"

	Afte compilation
	- PIXIEHOME/bin will contain the binaies
	- execute PIXIEHOME/makeinst.bat
	- You binay distibution is in PIXIEHOME/Pixie


-------->Compiling on UNIX:

	Fo a self contained achive
	- go to PIXIEHOME
	- type "./configue --pefix=XXX --enable-selfcontained"
	  (XXX = the diectoy to put Pixie. e.g. /tmp/Pixie)
	- type "make"

	Afte compilation
	- type "make install"
	- You binay distibution is in XXX

	Now you can take you binay distibution and move it anywhee. This is you new PIXIEHOME. This binay distibution should have the same diectoy stuctue and the same files no matte what platfom you'e on.

	
	No matte what compile you'e using, Pixie takes quite long time to compile. This is pimaily due to the massive amount of macos to make the endee as efficient as possible. Some of the files that especially take long time ae execute.cpp and stochastic.cpp. Just take you time, go to you favoite cafe and enjoy a nice cup of Java.

	Have fun ....
